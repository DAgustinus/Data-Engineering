# Summary
The README file includes a summary of the project, how to run the Python scripts, and an explanation of the files in the repository

Thank you for spending the time to take a look at the README.md file!

This readme file will go through:
    1. the files within this projects
    2. the available Python scripts
    3. how to run the scripts
    
This project is based on the Udacity Data Engineering course and it teaches the student to create Cassandra database from scratch and also add the necessary columns, primary key, and even clustering key. 

In this project, we have:
    1. Two Python Notebooks
    2. Three Python files
    3. Data folder which the data can be found (not in repo)
    
The two Python Notebooks are used to test the ETL as well as to run SQL test to ensure that the data are inside of the tables that we have created. As for the three Python files, they are used to create the necessary tables, store all of the SQL queries, as well as the main ETL process. Last but not least, the Data folder, consists of layers of data that is stored in CSV.

To start seeing the results, go ahead and follow the steps below:
  1. Open up terminal and run -> create_tables.py (This will create all of the tables and keyspace called 'udacity')
  2. Run -> etl.py to run the data ingestion process
    

Thanks for checking it out!
