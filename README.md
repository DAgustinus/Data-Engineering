# Welcome to my Data Engineer Showcase!

Hi! I'm **Dan A. Pesiwarissa**. I'm very passionate in the field of Data Engineering and I have a strong interest in it.


## What is this Repo about?

These are some of my works that I've done in the past. I've created an ETL process using Python to pick up data and store it into a NoSQL / Relational Database.

## Folders Information

Each folders have an **etl.py** as well as **create_tables.py** automation file which can be plugged into an automation platform in the future. To view some of the ETLs that I have created, you can go ahead and check out below:
